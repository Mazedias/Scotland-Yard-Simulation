# Scotland-Yard-Simulation
This program is to model the board game "Scotland Yard" and, by Mr. X's choice of transport, indicate on which squares he can stand.

**This is not meant to be a *playable version* of this board game but a nice task to get to know graphs better.**

# Details
The game is to be modeled in terms of 3 graphs (each representing a means of transportation). 
For the time being, Mr. X's choice of means of transport should be able to be entered through a console. 
After each input the possible whereabouts are to be output. Since this is my first own project with graphs I am 
happy about suggestions for improvement.

# Goals
- Model of the game board in the form of graphs
- Input option for the selected means of transport
- Output of the possible whereabouts of Mr. X

## Future goals
- Each field should be given a value to give better predictions of Mr. X's whereabouts.
- The best path to the last known position of Mr. X should be output (for each detective).
  Possible extension: The detectives are not sent to the last position, but each detective is sent to a different region where Mr. X could be.
- Graphical interface (after all functions are finished)
